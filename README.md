# Python Foundations

This repository is a structured learning path for Python, starting from zero and progressing toward
engineering-oriented use cases such as signals, control systems, and simulations.

## Goals
- Learn Python fundamentals correctly
- Understand and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Use math and numerical tools (NumPy)
- Write clean, testable code
- Build a foundation for signal processing and control

## Structure (planned)
- basics/     – syntax, functions, control flow
- oop/        – classes, objects, design principles
- math/       – vectors, matrices, numerical methods
- tests/      – unit testing with pytest
- notebooks/  – experiments and visualizations

## Status
🚧 In progress – starting from zero, step by step.
